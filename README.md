# Generalizable Task Planning Simulation
## Overview
This repository contains the PyBullet simulation to generate the dataset used to train a Machine Learning algorithm that will enable robots to perform multi-step manipulation tasks in unseen environments. Inspired by recent advanced in Representation Learning and Reactive Task execution, our model leverage pretraining on large-scale datasets.

## Simulation
PyBullet is used to generate the dataset to train the ML model. The input of the model is a series of RGB-D images and the Joint State of an arm robot over a series of time steps sampled at a specified frequency.
